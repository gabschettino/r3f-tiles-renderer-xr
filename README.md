# r3f-tiles-renderer-xr
iModel visualization using 3D Tiles Renderer, combined with Google Photorealistic Tiles in Cesium.

The goal is to transform this into an XR experience once some issues—such as atmosphere integration, iModel tiling, and performance optimization—are resolved.

Some inital testing was made without using r3f, and results were nice.
